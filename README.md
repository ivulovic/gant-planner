This project aims at utilising DHTMLX Gantt Chart library for creating a React.js based Gantt Chart app.

## Available Features

User can:

    - 'Add/Update/Remove tasks'

    - Zoom in at three levels:
        > Months
        > Days

    - Modify existing tasks':
        > Start Time

Apart from these, dhtmlxGantt library provides more features which have not been explored by me while creating this project.
